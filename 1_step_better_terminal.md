To install ohmyzsh we need to install wget first so run `brew install wget`

now install ohmyzsh by running

```bash
sh -c "$(wget https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"
```

Go to http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized

Scroll down and download the Theme (solarized.zip)

Extract the solarized.zip file

Open the osx-terminal.app-colors-solarized folder. This folder contains Theme for the terminal.

Double click “Solarized Dark ansi.terminal” file — This is the specific Theme file for Terminal.app. Note: If you get a warning that this is from an unidentified 

developer, Right-click on the file and select “Open with” > Terminal option.

At this point, you have the Theme installed into your Terminal. We just need to make it a default Theme.

Open Terminal > Preferences > Text and select the “Solarized Dark …” theme and click on “Default”.
